## Text to be killed 

The idea of DSL hasn't been introduced in the book yet. It will come only in chapter 10 ("Systems Need Domain-Specific Languages") and it's a bit of a mess.

"Clean code" is not the best book to learn about DSLs. You might get better understanding by reading:
* [Domain Specific Languages by by Martin Fowler, with Rebecca Parsons](https://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html) - comprehensive intro to the topic in a Martin Fowler style
* [DSL in Action by Debasish Ghosh](https://www.manning.com/books/dsls-in-action) - more practical and focused on internal DSLs in different host languages

DSLs are powerful. And it is important to know when to use them and when to stay away.

Introduction of any DSL has a noticeable cost: 
- higher learning curve
- higher maintenance cost: more code, more entities, more corner cases to support the langugae
- potentially worse performance

And in this example, introduced DSL brings zero value. It has a very limited scope, it's not composable and not extendable. It solves a trivial problem. 
I can understand the desire to show off, but in a large code base isolated DSLs like this one would grow like warts.
